   <blockquote><article>India is a truly diverse country, be it culturally or geographically. No two cities or states are the same! And that means, there are plenty of amazing holiday destinations for different types of travellers, across the country. However, there are certain places that are heavily frequented by tourists and some people even end up visiting the same destination several times. Such cliched destinations have a charm of their own though and usually promise a timeless experience every time. So, in this blog, we will talk about the top 15 places to visit in India that are totally worth the hype.</article>

The union territory is frequented by tourists year-round, especially in the winter season when the climate is pleasant, and the entire place comes alive with Christmas and New Year celebrations. Goa is definitely one of the top 5 tourist places in India. However, seasoned tourists do not shun Goa during summer either. If you are looking for a peaceful and economical holiday, try to visit Goa during the offseason when the sun-kissed beaches, flea markets, and other attractions are less crowded.</article>
